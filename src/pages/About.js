          As an early adapter of social media, Liza has throughout the years
          obtained a deep understanding of content creation, social engagement,

          Liza’s aesthetic is both personally and professionally recognizable
          for the well-thought-through balance between classic Scandinavian
          minimalism and eye-catching twists. This cross-over enables her to
          have a good understanding of both the Scandinavian and the
          international markets.
